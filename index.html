                 But the crow could not reach that water. She started to feel more thirsty. She again looked at her surroundings
                 and found some pebbles nearby. So she took the pebbles one by one and started to drop them inside the pitcher. 
                 Then water level started to increase. When she finally dropped all the pebbles, the water level reached her.
                 She drank the water and queen hard thirst.

                    <p>A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.

                      The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.

                      Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.

                      "What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for."

                       And off he walked very, very scornfully.

                  <p>Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside. To entertain himself, he sang out, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!”

                        When the villagers heard the cry, they ran up the hill to drive the wolf away. But when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when he saw their angry faces.
                        
                        “Don’t scream wolf when there is no wolf, boy!” the villagers warned. They angrily went back down the hill.
                        <br>
                        Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!” To his amusement, the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away.
                        <br>
                        As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly, “Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there is no wolf!” But the boy grinned at their words while they walked, grumbling down the hill once more.
                        <br>
                        Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock. Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried out as loud as he could, “Wolf! Wolf!” But the villagers thought he was fooling them again, and they didn’t come to help.
                        <br><br>
                        
                        At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn’t returned with their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him weeping.
                        <br>
                        “There was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, ‘Wolf!’ but you didn’t come,” he wailed.
                        <br>
                        An older man went to comfort the boy. As he put his arm around him, he said, “Nobody believes a liar, even when he is telling the truth!”</p>

                        <p>There once was a king named Midas who did a good deed for a satyr — a spirit of nature. Dionysus, the god of wine, then granted him a wish.

                              For his wish, Midas asked that whatever he touched would turn to gold. Despite Dionysus’ efforts to prevent it, Midas pleaded that this was a fantastic wish, so it was bestowed.
                              
                              Excited about his newly-earned powers, Midas started touching all kinds of things, turning each item into pure gold.
                              
                              But soon, Midas became hungry. As he picked up a piece of food, he found he couldn’t eat it. It had turned to gold in his hand.
                              
                              
                              Hungry, Midas groaned, “I’ll starve! Perhaps this was not such an excellent wish after all!”
                              
                              Seeing his dismay, Midas’ beloved daughter threw her arms around him to comfort him, and she, too, turned to gold. “The golden touch is no blessing,” Midas cried.

                        <p>Once upon a time, in a desert far away, there was a rose who was so proud of her beautiful looks. Her only complaint was that she was growing next to an ugly cactus.

                              Every day, the beautiful rose would insult and mock the cactus about his looks, all while the cactus remained quiet. All the other plants nearby tried to make the rose see sense, but she was too swayed by her own looks.
                              
                              One scorching summer, the desert became dry, and there was no water left for the plants. The rose quickly began to wilt. Her beautiful petals dried up, losing their lush color.
                              
                              
                              Looking to the cactus, she saw a sparrow dip his beak into the cactus to drink some water. Though ashamed, the rose asked the cactus if she could have some water. The kind cactus readily agreed, helping them both through the tough summer as friends.</p>

                              Deflated, the elephant continued to search and stumbled across a rabbit. She asked him, “Can we be friends, rabbit?”
                              <br>
                              The rabbit looked at the elephant and replied, “You are too big to fit inside my burrow. You cannot be my friend.”
                              <br>
                              The elephant continued until she met a frog. She asked, “Will you be my friend, frog?”
                              <br>
                              The frog replied, “You are too big and heavy; you cannot jump like me. I am sorry, but you can’t be my friend.”
                              <br>
                              The elephant continued to ask the animals she met on her way but always received the same reply. The following day, the elephant saw all the forest animals run in fear. She stopped a bear to ask what was happening and was told the tiger was attacking all the small animals.
                              <br><br>
                              
                              The elephant wanted to save the other animals, so she went to the tiger and said, “Please, sir, leave my friends alone. Do not eat them.”
                              
                              The tiger didn’t listen. He merely told the elephant to mind her own business.
                              
                              Seeing no other way, the elephant kicked the tiger and scared him away. After hearing the brave tale, the other animals agreed, “You are just the right size to be our friend.”</p>

                        <p>One bright autumn day, a family of ants was busy working in the warm sunshine. They were drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer when a starving grasshopper came up. With his fiddle under his arm, the grasshopper humbly begged for a bite to eat.

                              “What!” cried the ants, “Haven’t you stored any food away for the winter? What in the world were you doing all summer?”
                              
                              “I didn’t have time to store any food before winter,” the grasshopper whined. “I was so busy making music that the summer flew by.”
                              
                              
                              The ants simply shrugged and said, “Making music, were you? Very well, now dance!” The ants then turned their backs on the grasshopper and returned to work.

                        <h1 class="text-success mb-5">The bundle of Sticks</h1>
                        <p>Once upon a time, there was a man who lived in a village with his three sons. Although his three sons were hard workers, they quarreled all the time. The old man tried to unite them but failed.

                              Months passed by, and the man became sick. He asked his grown sons to remain united, but they failed to listen to him. At that moment, the man decided to teach them a lesson — to forget their differences and come together in unity.
                              
                              The man summoned his sons. When they had gathered, he said, “I will provide you with a bundle of sticks. Separate each stick, and then break each into two. The one who finishes first will be rewarded more than the others.”
                              <br>
                              And so, the sons agreed. The man provided them with a bundle of ten sticks each and then asked the sons to break each stick into pieces. The sons broke the sticks within minutes, then proceeded to quarrel among themselves again.
                              
                              The old man said, “My dear sons, the game is not yet over. I will now give you another bundle of sticks. Only this time, you will have to break them together as a bundle, not separately.”
                              <br><br>
                              
                              The sons readily agreed and then tried to break the bundle. Despite trying their best, they could not break the sticks. The sons told their father of their failure.
                              <br>
                              The old man said, “My dear sons, see! Breaking every single stick individually was easy for you, but breaking them in a bundle, you could not do. By staying united, nobody can harm you. If you continue to quarrel, then anyone can quickly defeat you.”
                              
                              The old man continued, “I ask that you stay united.” The three sons then understood that there’s power in unity and promised their father they would all stay together.</p>
